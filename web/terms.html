  <h1>ANCHORAGE</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Terms of Service</div>
  <div class="effective">Effective: 25 February 2026</div>
</div>

<div class="content">

<p>By downloading, installing, or using ANCHORAGE ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

<h2>1. Age Requirement</h2>
<p>You must be at least <strong>18 years of age</strong> to use ANCHORAGE. By using the App, you confirm that you are 18 or older. We do not knowingly provide services to anyone under 18.</p>

<h2>2. Not a Substitute for Professional Treatment</h2>
<div class="warning-box">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> ANCHORAGE is a self-help tool designed to support your personal goals. It is <strong>not</strong> a substitute for professional mental health treatment, therapy, counselling, or medical advice.</p>
</div>
<p>If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, please contact a qualified professional or call a crisis helpline immediately. ANCHORAGE provides emergency contact information within the app as a convenience, but we are not a mental health provider.</p>
<p>We do not make any claims that ANCHORAGE will cure, treat, or prevent any condition. Your use of the App is entirely at your own discretion.</p>

<h2>3. Content Filtering Disclaimer</h2>
<p>ANCHORAGE uses DNS-based filtering and app interception to help block access to explicit content. However:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We <strong>do not guarantee</strong> that all explicit content will be blocked</li>
  <li>New domains and content may not be covered by the blocklist immediately</li>
  <li>The blocklist is sourced from third-party community-maintained lists and may contain errors</li>
  <li>VPN-based filtering can be bypassed by the user if they choose to disable it</li>
  <li>App interception relies on system permissions that may behave differently across devices and Android versions</li>
</ul>
<p>ANCHORAGE is designed as an aid, not a guarantee. You acknowledge that no content filtering solution is 100% effective.</p>

<h2>4. User Responsibility</h2>
<p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your own recovery journey and personal choices</li>
  <li>Maintaining the permissions ANCHORAGE needs to function (Usage Access, Display Over Apps, VPN, Battery)</li>
  <li>The accuracy of any information you provide (such as accountability partner contact details)</li>
  <li>Ensuring that any accountability partner you add has consented to receive progress reports from you</li>
  <li>Keeping your device secure and the app updated</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Accountability Partner Feature</h2>
<p>If you choose to add an accountability partner:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are responsible for obtaining their consent before adding their email address</li>
  <li>Weekly reports contain only general progress data (streak count, milestones) &mdash; never specific urge logs, reflection content, or browsing data</li>
  <li>You can remove your accountability partner at any time through the app</li>
  <li>We are not responsible for any consequences arising from the accountability relationship</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

<h3>6.1 Free Tier</h3>
<p>ANCHORAGE offers a free tier with limited features, including a maximum of 3 guarded apps. The free tier may be used indefinitely at no cost.</p>

<h3>6.2 ANCHORAGE+ (Premium)</h3>
<p>ANCHORAGE+ is available as a monthly, annual, or lifetime subscription. Subscriptions are processed through the Google Play Store and managed by RevenueCat.</p>

<h3>6.3 Billing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Payment is charged to your Google Play account at confirmation of purchase</li>
  <li>Monthly and annual subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period</li>
  <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription through the Google Play Store at any time</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.4 Refunds</h3>
<p>Refund requests are handled by the Google Play Store in accordance with their <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637" target="_blank">refund policy</a>. We do not process refunds directly.</p>

<h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>All content, design, code, and branding of ANCHORAGE (including the name, logo, anchor imagery, and nautical theme) are the property of ANCHORAGE and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from any part of the App without our written permission.</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ANCHORAGE is provided <strong>"as is"</strong> and <strong>"as available"</strong> without warranties of any kind, either express or implied</li>
  <li>We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that all explicit content will be blocked</li>
  <li>We shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App</li>
  <li>Our total liability to you for any claims arising from these Terms or your use of the App shall not exceed the amount you have paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim, or AUD $50, whichever is greater</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless ANCHORAGE, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>

<h2>10. Termination</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, for any reason, without notice. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it.</p>

<h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria, Australia.</p>

<h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. We will notify you of material changes through an in-app notice.</p>

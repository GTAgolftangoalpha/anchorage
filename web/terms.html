  <h1>ANCHORAGE</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Terms of Service</div>
  <div class="effective">Effective: 25 February 2026</div>
</div>

<div class="content">

<p>ANCHORAGE is published by <strong>Temporal Psychology</strong>. By downloading, installing, or using ANCHORAGE ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

<h2>1. Age Requirement</h2>
<p>You must be at least <strong>18 years of age</strong> to use ANCHORAGE. By using the App, you confirm that you are 18 or older.</p>

<h2>2. Not a Substitute for Professional Treatment</h2>
<div class="warning-box">
  <p><strong>Important:</strong> ANCHORAGE is a self-help tool designed to support your personal goals. It is <strong>not</strong> a substitute for professional mental health treatment, therapy, counselling, or medical advice.</p>
</div>
<p>If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, please contact a qualified professional or call a crisis helpline immediately. We do not make any claims that ANCHORAGE will cure, treat, or prevent any condition.</p>

<h2>3. Content Filtering Disclaimer</h2>
<p>ANCHORAGE uses DNS-based filtering and app interception to help block access to explicit content. However:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We <strong>do not guarantee</strong> that all explicit content will be blocked</li>
  <li>New domains may not be covered immediately</li>
  <li>The blocklist is sourced from third-party community-maintained lists</li>
  <li>VPN filtering can be disabled by the user at any time</li>
  <li>App interception may behave differently across devices and Android versions</li>
</ul>
<p>ANCHORAGE is an aid, not a guarantee. No content filtering solution is 100% effective.</p>

<h2>4. User Responsibility</h2>
<p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your own recovery journey and personal choices</li>
  <li>Maintaining the permissions ANCHORAGE needs to function</li>

  <li>Ensuring your accountability partner consents to receive reports</li>
  <li>Keeping your device secure and the app updated</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Accountability Partner Feature</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You must obtain your partner's consent before adding their email</li>
  <li>Reports contain only general progress data (streak count, milestones) &mdash; never urge logs, reflections, or browsing data</li>
  <li>You can remove your accountability partner at any time</li>
  <li>We are not responsible for consequences arising from the accountability relationship</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Prohibited Use: Monitoring Others Without Consent</h2>
<div class="warning-box">
  <p>You must <strong>not</strong> use ANCHORAGE to monitor, track, or restrict another person's device usage without their full knowledge and informed consent. ANCHORAGE is designed as a <strong>voluntary self-help tool</strong>. Using it to covertly monitor a partner, family member, or any other person is a violation of these Terms and may violate applicable laws.</p>
